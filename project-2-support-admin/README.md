# Project 2 – Linux User Creation & Privilege Assignment

In this project, I created a new Linux user called supportadmin and securely granted it sudo (admin) privileges. I also verified the user’s permission escalation and documented the commands used.

## What I Did:
- Added a new user: supportadmin
- Assigned the user to the sudo group
- Verified elevated privileges using whoami

## Why It Matters:
Proper user creation and privilege delegation is key to Linux system administration and cloud security. Only authorized users should be granted admin rights.

## Screenshot:
Check the screenshots/ folder for visual proof of sudo access.
