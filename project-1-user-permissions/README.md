# Project 1: Linux User and Group Permissions

This was my first hands-on Linux project where I learned how to manage users, groups, and file permissions using the command line.

I used Ubuntu (via WSL on Windows) to create different user roles, assign them to groups, and control access to shared folders. It’s a basic but important part of what system and cloud security is all about — giving the right access to the right people.

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Created user groups: devs and security
- Added users: admin, analyst, developer
- Assigned each user to their correct group
- Created shared directories: /data/dev and /data/sec
- Set folder permissions using chmod and ownership with chown
